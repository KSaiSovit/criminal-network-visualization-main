'''
1. test_timestamp_format_should_convert_datetime_to_rfc_5322_timestamp():
    - Ensures the timestamp_format function correctly converts a datetime object to an RFC 5322 GMT timestamp string.
    - Test Case:
        - Creates a datetime object representing February 1, 2020, at 22:15:13.
        - Defines the expected output as "Sat, 1 Feb 2020 22:15:13 GMT".
        - Calls timestamp_format with the datetime object and asserts the returned value matches the expected output.
2. test_log_format_should_format_args_in_logfmt():
    - Verifies the log_format function constructs a log message string in the logfmt format.
    - Test Case:
        - Generates a unique request ID using uuid4().
        - Sets the log message to "Request made".
        - Defines a dictionary params with a key-value pair "data": "foo".
        - Creates the expected formatted message string using f-strings.
        - Calls log_format with the request ID, message, and parameters.
        - Asserts the returned formatted message matches the expected string.
