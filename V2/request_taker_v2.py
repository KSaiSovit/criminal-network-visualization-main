It returns a dictionary where keys are task IDs and values are dictionaries describing available methods.

Tasks:
- name: Full analysis task name as a string.
- methods: A dictionary with keys as internal method names and values as further dictionaries.
    - Each method dictionary contains:
        - name: Full method name as a string.
        - parameter: A dictionary where keys are parameter names and values are parameter details.
            - Each parameter dictionary contains:

                - options: A dictionary where keys are accepted parameter values and values are full parameter value names.

'''
This class performs different network analysis tasks (community detection, social influence analysis, etc.) in-memory.
It takes analysis tasks as input and calls corresponding sub-analyzers based on the task ID

- It initializes different analyzer objects (e.g., community_detector) as attributes.
- The perform_analysis method handles task requests.
    - It retrieves the network, algorithm, and parameters from the task dictionary.
    - Based on the task ID, it calls the corresponding sub-analyzer's perform method with the network and parameters.
    - It returns 1 if successful, 0 otherwise.
