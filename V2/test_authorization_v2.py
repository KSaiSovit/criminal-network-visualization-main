'''
- Tests if the process_request method correctly adds the user information to the request context when an authorization header is present.
- Test Setup:
    - prepared_request fixture:
        - Creates a mock request object (prepared_request) with an authorization header containing a valid token for the user "admin".
    - Patching:
        - Patches the auth_dataset attribute of the auth_graph module with a mocked BuiltinDataset object.
        - This mock is likely used to access user and role information for authorization.
    - Data Creation:
        - Creates a role named "User" with priority 0 and a user named "admin" assigned to it within the mocked dataset.
- Test Execution:
    - Calls the process_request method of the AuthorizationComponent object with the prepared request and a mock response object.
- Assertion:
    - Checks if the user attribute in the request context is set correctly.
    - Specifically, it verifies that the username of the retrieved user object is "admin".
